\section{Introduction}
Every car in the United States since 1996 is required, by law, to contain on-board diagnostics. This standard, codified in SAE J1939 as on-board diagnostics II (OBD-II), is used for everything from reading fuel levels, to checking engine warnings for diagnostic purposes. The OBD-II specification specifically requires cars to make available a port in every car that can be used to read messages. A device is then plugged into this port to read messages over various protocols implemented by the car manufacturer. Currently, technicians must manually plug in a device into this port in order to read OBD-II messages. Our project aims to add wireless functionality for OBD-II via Bluetooth to be interfaced with Android compatible devices. Furthermore this project aims to make communication cryptographically secure.


\section{Project Requirements}
This project has quite a few objectives because there are quite a few parts to it. In Appendix I is a diagram to show the purposed information exchange for this project.

\subsection {OBD-II Interface Board (OIB)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The biggest requirement for this project is the development of a circuit which will have the functionality to interface directly to a car's OBD-II port. 
	\item This board will need to be able to act as a transceiver with the OBD-II port. \\
	\item The board will also be responsible for encoding and decoding messages for each of the protocols allowed in the OBD-II standard which are:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item SAE J/1850 (PWM/VPW)
		\item ISO 15765-2 / SAE J2284 (CAN)
		\item SAE J2411 (Single Wire CAN)
		\item ISO 9141-2/14230-4 (Keyword Protocol)
		\item Ford DCL (Mostly Depreciated) 
	\end{enumerate}
	\item This board will be required to communicate with the Bluetooth interface board (BIB) in via some still-undecided standard protocol.
	\item This board will be powered from the OBD-II port. Which will mean adding voltage regulators, most likely linear voltage regulators.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bluetooth Interface Board (BIB)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This board must be able to communicate with the OBD-II interface board via some still-undecided standard protocol.
	\item This board will also be responsible for implementing the encryption scheme via some still-undecided scheme. (See crypto section)
	\item This board will be responsible for communicating via Bluetooth to Android enabled devices.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bluetooth Functionality Android-side}
Java!

\subsection{Cryptographically Securing Messages}
The board/device that implements crypto functionality will be responsible for:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Storing a private key.
	\item Generating a public key upon request.
	\item Validating devices to use with the OIB.
	\item Encrypting messages using some still-undecided protocol.
	\item Communicating these encrypted messages to other parts of the system.
	\item Decrypting messages received from the BIB.
\end{itemize}
