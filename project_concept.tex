\section{Introduction}
Every car in the United States since 1996 is required, by law, to contain on-board diagnostics. This standard, codified in SAE J1939 as on-board diagnostics II (OBD-II), is used for everything from reading fuel levels, to checking engine warnings for diagnostic purposes. The OBD-II specification specifically requires cars to make available a port in every car that can be used to read messages. A device is then plugged into this port to read messages over various protocols implemented by the car manufacturer. Currently, technicians must manually plug in a device into this port in order to read OBD-II messages. Our project aims to add wireless functionality for OBD-II via Bluetooth to be interfaced with Android compatible devices. Furthermore this project aims to make communication cryptographically secure.


\section{Project Objectives}
This project has quite a few objectives

\subsection{Bluetooth Functionality Board-side}
Wireless!

\subsection{Bluetooth Functionality Android-side}
Java!

\subsection{Cryptographically Securing Messages}
Using generic over the counter crypto

\subsection{Power Requirements}
Needs to be able to be powered of car's power.
