\section*{Executive Summary}
A user with an Android based phone will be able to read and interpret diagnostic and operational data from their 1996 model year or newer car. On some models, they will be able to control some aspects of the car, such as starting the engine or rolling down the windows. This will be accomplished by having their Android device pair with a OBD (On-board Diagnostic) interface that is connected to the car over bluetooth, using a secure channel.
